# Analysis of Fortune 1000 Companies

## Introduction
Fortune, an American Business Magazine, publishes the Fortune 500 every year, which ranks the top 500 companies in terms of revenue. Instead of only the top 500, this dataset contains the whole Fortune 1000. This data can be used to answer questions about the gender distribution of CEOs, the financial performance of companies over time, and the industries that generate the most profit and revenue.

## Visualization Insights
Retailing sector had the highest number and proportion of female CEOs among all sectors from 2019 to 2021. Telecommunications sector had no female-led companies during the same period. Financial sector had the highest number of listed companies in all three years. Media and telecommunications sectors consistently did not have any companies with female leadership. Food & drug stores sector had the highest proportion of female CEOs in 2021. Technology and healthcare sectors showed increased representation in the Fortune 1000 list in 2021. Overall, this view indicates that there may be gender disparities in CEO representation across sectors, with some sectors showing higher proportion of female CEOs while others lagging behind. Technology and Healthcare sectors have increased representation over the years. Sheet 2 Sheet 2 filters let users choose sectors, years, CEO gender and performance metrics. Companies are visualized as map points coloured by gender and sized by performance metrics. Correlating them with the male-to-female ratio on the background layer reveals insights into gender representation, location, and financial performance.  Selecting all sectors, years, CEO genders and revenue as the performance metric shows more Fortune 1000 companies from the Eastern US than the West. Switching between CEO genders shows male-led companies spread out over the country while female-led companies are more common in regions with lower male-to-female ratios, indicated by the brownish-yellow background. Overall, there may be a correlation between a company's location, leadership gender, and the state's male-to-female ratio, but further research is needed to establish causation and identify other factors. Sheet 3 Using filters for sectors, years and performance metric of profit or revenue lets users compare the male and female CEOs’ selected metric. Filtering years and sectors reveals variation in gender performance over the years, favouring either male-led or female-led companies in different years.  For the healthcare sector, we see female-led companies more successful in 2021. Selecting Profit or Revenue in the performance metric dropdown shows that while male-led companies have greater median profits and revenue, female-led companies have greater spread indicating more variability in profits and revenue. Selecting sectors through dashboard actions on the donut chart, reveals exceptions to this trend. Female-led companies in the Aerospace & Defense and Motor Vehicles & Parts sectors generated higher average profits and revenue than their male counterparts. As for the answer to Q1, while more research is needed to answer how the male-to-female ratio influences the gender balance in a company’s leadership, CEO gender can surely impact the company’s financial performance within some sectors and in some years. Over the years, female leadership roles have increased across sectors, with a positive effect on performance, including technology and healthcare, which should provide the intended insight to the user. Sheet 4 The primary filter on sheet 4 allows the user to select performance metrics of Profit, Revenue and Number of Employees. The bar chart displays the average selected performance metric for each of the three years.

Employee count Food & Drug Stores and Retailing reported increased revenue and employee count in 2021. Healthcare and Hospitality sectors reported lower revenues and reduced employee count. Wholesalers, Transportation, and Motor Vehicles hired more employees despite lower revenue. Sheet 5 A word cloud is generated with the top 10 companies within the selected sector and year. The size of the company represents the performance metric, and companies are clustered into 3 groups with similar growth rates to show performance trends.   The diagram below shows how clusters of companies with similar growth rates are formed in the wordcloud. Note that the clusters may change based on the selected parameters.

## Revenue Trends
Food & Drug Stores, Retailing, and Technology sectors consistent grew from 2019 to 2021, while Financials and Industrials declined. In 2021, sectors such as Aerospace & Defense, Energy, Hotels, and Transportation, which were impacted by COVID-19, saw a decrease in revenue, while Retailing and Technology flourished. The top 10 companies by revenue in all three years belong to the Energy, Financials, Healthcare, Retailing, Technology, and Telecommunications sectors, with healthcare and technology dominating the list in 2019 and 2021 respectively.  In fact, Female-led companies in the healthcare sector performed well. Walmart has consistently been the top company in terms of revenue in all three years, followed by Amazon. 

## Profit Trends
The telecommunications sector is a profitable sector, but it is also a male-dominated sector. The technology sector is growing, with companies like Apple leading the way. It is also a sector where female CEOs are starting to make their mark. The Energy, Hospitality, and Transportation sectors struggled during 2020-2021, but sectors such as Retailing and Technology, were able to weather the storm and even grow. Financials, Technology, and Telecommunications sectors dominate the top 10 companies. As for the number of employees, Walmart is the top employer in all three years, followed by Amazon. Retailing dominates as the largest employer among companies. In conclusion, the performance of sectors within the top 1000 companies has been dynamic from 2019 to 2021. Some sectors have experienced growth, while others have faced challenges. The technology sector has been a bright spot, with companies like Apple leading the way. Female-led companies in the healthcare sector have also performed well. Overall, the performance of sectors and companies within the top 1000 companies has been varied, with some sectors experiencing growth and others facing challenges. Reflective Discussion In this analysis of the Fortune 1000 dataset, we focused on analysing the performance of sectors within the top 1000 companies from 2019 to 2021. We also looked at how the gender of a company's CEO and its distribution across sectors impact its revenue and profits, and how its location correlates with the state's male-to-female ratio.  We used Tableau to create a dashboard to provide insights into the different aspects of the research question. The analysis found that some sectors had more female CEOs than others, while some had none. The technology and healthcare sectors saw an increase in female CEOs in 2021, which could be an opportunity for Ms Smith's company. However, more research is needed to determine the cause of these trends. Overall, the project was a valuable learning experience, providing insights into the gender distribution of CEOs, the performance metrics of companies, and the potential opportunities and challenges in the healthcare sector. Tableau Dashboard provided valuable insights into the research questions with relative ease of use as compared to PowerBI, but it also had some limitations, such as limited forms of customization available, e.g., no donut charts by default. Moreover, PowerBI being Windows-only limits the options for non-Windows users. Conclusion This project analyses the gender representation of Fortune 1000 companies across sectors and locations, and the correlation between gender diversity and financial performance. The project aims to identify trends and patterns in the data and gather insights into potential opportunities or challenges for diversity in the healthcare industry. The dashboard uses filters to choose sectors, years, CEO gender, and performance metrics to compare the data. The project found that there are gender disparities in CEO representation across sectors, with some sectors showing higher proportions of female CEOs while others lag behind. Additionally, the study indicates that CEO gender can impact a company's financial performance within some sectors and in some years. Technology and Healthcare sectors have increased representation over the years, showing a positive effect on performance. Overall, the project provides valuable insights into gender diversity and financial performance in Fortune 1000 companies. References kb.tableau.com. (n.d.).
